The next version of the Shady Fit program

## 2020.03.24

I put in a "3, 2, 1" countdown before the exercises to give the users time to switch. I like it. I also moved the image preloader to this countdown screen to take advantage of the time window it opened. I might be able to play with the JSON a bit to get access to the first image faster but I'm pretty happy with what I've got. 

I've asked around a little bit for connections to illustrators but so far no luck. Tomorrow I'm going to reach out directly to the people I borrowed the images from.

#### First Notes

This is one possible version of the app. I have predefined workouts that the user can choose from and the program runs through them all giving you a simple display of how to execute those workouts. Next up, I'm going to add an image preloader so there's no weird glitches in the animation.

-------------------------

I added the image preloader. It doesn't work exactly like I wanted it to but it mostly works. I've put in a lot of work on the CSS of this project as well, making sure it looks good on phones and on desktops (it looks better on a phone). Now I just need to find illustrations I have permission to use...
