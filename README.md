# [Shady Fit 2.0](https://dkallen78.github.io/shady-fit-2.0/shadyFitV2.0.html)

The next version of the Shady Fit program

## 2020.03.23

#### First Notes

This is one possible version of the app. I have predefined workouts that the user can choose from and the program runs through them all giving you a simple display of how to execute those workouts. Next up, I'm going to add an image preloader so there's no weird glitches in the animation.

-------------------------

I added the image preloader. It doesn't work exactly like I wanted it to but it mostly works. I've put in a lot of work on the CSS of this project as well, making sure it looks good on phones and on desktops (it looks better on a phone). Now I just need to find illustrations I have permission to use...
